# Face Cleaner

Application for fully atomated trimming and cleaning of triangular 3D facial scans.

see thesis pdf.

## Overview and features

The whole algorithm used for the trimming and cleaning process is pretty complex and consists of several independent phases. 
However, most of these phases uses approximations of curvature at mesh vertices.

The following diagram ilustrates the worklow of our algorithm:
